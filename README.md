Hey guys im opensourcing this so my teacher cant claim credit for my work and publish it as her own.
she gave me the most useless fucking assignment to recognize emotions using ECHOCARDIOGRAM data. the idiot wouldnt even listen to my concerns on how its absolutely
impossible because of the lack of emotional context behind any of the available echocardioram datasets available, and the inherent complexity of the enitre task

but lo and behold after a million fucking hours of debugging i created a highly theoretical working model using features which have very low relation to emotional context using the 
uci machine learning echocardiogram repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/38/echocardiogram (because this was the only dataset my teacher could find for us) 
the bumbling idiot doesnt even know shit about AI SHE JUST GAVE US A RANDOM FUCKING DATABASE.
